# GetaPro – Get a Professional

> **Role:** Mobile Developer (React Native)

**GetaPro** stands for **“Get a Professional.”**  
The goal was simple yet ambitious: to create a streamlined way for people to connect with verified legal and financial experts, all in one place.

## 💡 The Problem

Whether it’s filing taxes, drafting a contract, or setting up a business, people constantly need **reliable legal and financial advice**. But getting help is often:

- **Inconvenient** – Involves physical visits or endless website browsing.
- **Uncertain** – Hard to verify a professional’s credibility beforehand.
- **Slow** – Booking and communication take too long.

## 🛠️ Our Solution: A Professional Marketplace

We began building **GetaPro**, a digital platform to connect users with verified professionals via **video or audio calls** — quick, secure, and from anywhere.

### ✅ Key Features

1. **Professional Onboarding**
   - Verified experts list their services, pricing, and availability.
   - Credential verification to build trust and transparency.

2. **Smart Discovery Tools**
   - Users can filter by category, price, language, availability, etc.
   - Designed to reduce time from search to session.

3. **Easy Session Booking**
   - Book calls based on availability.
   - Pay by duration — for example, ₹300 for 15 minutes.

4. **Secure Document Sharing**
   - Users can upload and share relevant documents during calls.
   - End-to-end encryption built in.

5. **Ratings & Reviews**
   - Users leave feedback to maintain service quality and trust.

Important Note: This project is currently on **pause due to legal complications** related to marketplace licensing and professional compliance.  
However, working on GetaPro taught us invaluable lessons in product design, user needs, and startup execution.

## 🧩 My Contributions as a Mobile Developer

As the **mobile developer on the GetaPro team**, I was responsible for building the core app experience using React Native. I collaborated closely with web developer and designer to ensure consistency, performance, and seamless functionality across platforms. My focus was on delivering a smooth, accessible mobile product that aligned with the overall user experience and technical goals of the project.

- Architected scalable navigation and screen flow in React Native.
- Integrated REST APIs for user authentication, booking, payments, and messaging.
- Ensured accessibility and optimized performance across both mid-range and high-end devices.
- Worked closely with UI/UX designer to translate Figma designs into high-quality mobile screens.
- Collaborated with web developer for consistent cross-platform implementation and backend coordination.

## 👥 Who We Built It For

- **Individuals** needing help with legal or finance issues.
- **Startups** and **freelancers** dealing with compliance or contracts.
- **Professionals** looking for more clients without office overhead.

## 🔐 Trust & Security Built-In

We designed GetaPro with **security-first** principles:
- Verified professionals only
- Secure payments
- Encrypted sessions and document uploads

## 🚧 Where We Go From Here

While the project is **not in production**, the experience of building GetaPro has given us clarity on:
- Navigating legal hurdles in regulated marketplaces
- Understanding user pain points more deeply
- Prioritizing compliance early in the design and architecture phase

We’re optimistic that in the future, with the right legal support, we could relaunch GetaPro or apply these learnings to similar problem spaces.
