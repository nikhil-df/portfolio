# Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋

I love building products that solve real problems and **genuinely help people**. My journey into tech wasn’t just about writing code — it was (and still is) about using technology as a tool to **make life easier**, **work smarter**, and **connect meaningfully** with the world around me.

I’m not interested in building apps that just sit in storage — I want to create things that make a **real difference in people’s lives**. That’s what drives me every day as a developer.

## 💡 Why I Build

I build because I believe technology should improve lives — not just exist for the sake of it

What excites me most is seeing an idea move from a sketch or a thought into something that makes someone’s day easier, clearer, or less stressful.

Whether it’s a health app for seniors or a tool that helps people stay organized, I’m always driven by one question:

> “How can this actually help someone in their real life?”

For me, it’s not about building just to deploy — it’s about building with **purpose**, with **empathy**, and with the intention to make a **meaningful change**.

## 🔧 How I Work

I focus on building with **intention**, **clarity**, and **care** — always keeping the real user in mind:
- **Start lean**, **validate early** — solve real problems, not assumed ones
- **Move fast**, **but respect quality** — thoughtful iteration matters
- Design **simple**, human-centered flows — clarity beats complexity
- Code with **purpose** — every feature should serve a need, not just check a box


## 🚀 What I’ve Been Working On

Recently, I’ve worked on:
- **PillCare** — a caregiver app designed to help families support their senior loved ones with medication tracking and wellbeing monitoring.

This project is helping me dive deep into mobile architecture, realtime sync, and user-centered design — especially for non-tech-savvy users.

## 📚 I’m Always Learning

I’m always exploring ways to improve my mobile development skills and create better user experiences. Lately, I’ve been diving into:
- technologies like **React Native**, **Firebase**, **NativeWind**
- Clean architecture for scalable and maintainable mobile apps
- UI design principles to build interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing

I enjoy turning what I learn into real features — and whenever possible.

## 🧠 What I Value

- **Clarity > cleverness**
- **Honesty > hype**
- **Progress > perfection**
- **Impact > storage**

I believe that the best builders are curious, humble, and always willing to unlearn and relearn.

## ✨ What’s Next?

I’m always looking for:
- **New challenges** that push me beyond my comfort zone
- **People to collaborate with** on meaningful work
- **Ideas worth building**, even if it’s just an MVP to start

If you're working on something impactful — or just want to talk about ideas, tech, or life — I’d love to chat.
